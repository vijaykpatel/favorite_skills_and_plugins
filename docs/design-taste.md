## Overview

This skill encodes principles of good taste in design. The core insight is that taste is not subjective preference—it is a learnable sense for what makes something genuinely good. The same principles appear across math, engineering, writing, visual art, and software.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Designing something or creating UI/UX
- Reviewing or critiquing designs, code, or creative work
- Evaluating whether something is "good" or well-crafted
- Writing with aesthetic intent
- Users mention taste, aesthetics, beauty, elegance, or simplicity
- Making something not just functional but genuinely refined

The skill applies across domains: software, writing, visual design, architecture, presentations, APIs, data models, and more.

## Key Principles

| Principle | Summary |
|-----------|---------|
| **Simple** | Simplicity is the result of effort. Strip ornament; deliver substance. |
| **Timeless** | Ground choices in lasting principles, not trends. |
| **Solves the Right Problem** | Verify you're solving the right problem before implementing. |
| **Suggestive** | Leave room for imagination; give composable primitives, not rigid workflows. |
| **Slightly Funny** | Confidence and humor are related; a hint of playfulness signals mastery. |
| **Hard** | Great work comes from constraints; embrace productive struggle. |
| **Looks Easy** | Invest effort to make things appear effortless. |
| **Uses Symmetry** | Look for natural symmetries and recursive structures. |
| **Resembles Nature** | Solutions that converge with nature's optimization are often right. |
| **Is Redesign** | Expect iteration; treat first drafts as explorations. |
| **Can Copy** | Borrow from the best sources; trace influences to their origins. |
| **Often Strange** | Strangeness emerges from honest pursuit of quality. |
| **Happens in Chunks** | Seek environments where excellent work is happening. |
| **Often Daring** | Question conventions when the evidence supports something different. |

## Core Philosophy

> The recipe for great work: very exacting taste, plus the ability to gratify it.

It is often easier to see ugliness than to imagine beauty. Most great work happens because someone looks at the status quo and thinks, "I could do better than that." Cultivate intolerance for the mediocre.
