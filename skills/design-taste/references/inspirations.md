# Inspirations and Examples

Key works and creators referenced as exemplars of good design taste, organized by principle.

## Simplicity
- Mathematical proofs: shorter is better, fewer axioms is better
- Writing: "say what you mean and say it briefly"
- Architecture: beauty from structural elements, not superficial ornament

## Timelessness
- Albrecht Durer's engravings: left so little room for improvement that every engraver since lives in his shadow
- G. H. Hardy's dictum: "there is no permanent place in this world for ugly mathematics"

## Solving the Right Problem
- Stove dial arrangement: solving for human cognition, not geometric simplicity
- Typography: Times Roman lowercase 'g' vs sans-serif for legibility
- Physics: shifting from reconciling observation with scripture to predicting observable behavior

## Suggestiveness
- Jane Austen's novels: almost no description, yet you envision every scene
- The Mona Lisa: everyone invents their own story
- Software: Lego-brick composability over rigid workflows

## Humor and Lightness
- Durer's engravings, Saarinen's Womb Chair, the Pantheon, the Porsche 911
- Godel's incompleteness theorem as "a practical joke"
- Hitchcock's films, Bruegel's paintings, Shakespeare

## Difficulty and Constraint
- Kelly Johnson / Skunk Works: "an airplane that looked beautiful would fly the same way"
- Bauhaus: "form follows function" (Sullivan's original: "form ever follows function")
- Wild animals: beautiful because they have hard lives

## Effortlessness
- Leonardo's line drawings: just eight or ten lines in exactly the right place
- Good writing's conversational tone: achieved on the eighth rewrite

## Symmetry and Recursion
- The Eiffel Tower: a recursive solution, a tower on a tower
- Michelangelo's Creation of Adam, Grant Wood's American Gothic: compositional symmetry
- Cezanne's mosaics: whole picture built from the same atoms
- Inductive proofs, recursive algorithms

## Nature
- Boats with spines and ribs like an animal's ribcage
- Genetic algorithms imitating natural selection
- Early aircraft: premature biomimicry (not enough technology), but the principle is sound

## Redesign and Iteration
- Leonardo's sketches: five or six attempts per line
- The Porsche 911: iconic back emerged from redesigning an awkward prototype
- Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim: inverted the right half from ziggurat to current form
- Oil paint replacing tempera: a medium that makes change easy

## Copying and Influence
- The Pre-Raphaelites: rebelling not against Raphael but against derivative imitators of Raphael
- The three stages: unconscious imitation, pursuit of originality, mature selflessness

## Strangeness
- Euler's formula (e^(i*pi) = -1), Bruegel's Hunters in the Snow, the SR-71, Lisp
- Einstein: tried to make relativity true, not strange
- Michelangelo: not trying to paint like Michelangelo, just trying to paint well

## Environment and Community
- Fifteenth-century Florence: Brunelleschi, Ghiberti, Donatello, Masaccio, Botticelli, Leonardo, Michelangelo
- The Bauhaus, the Manhattan Project, the New Yorker, Lockheed's Skunk Works, Xerox PARC

## Daring
- Copernicus: intolerance for the equant hack that everyone else accepted
- Giotto: saw Byzantine madonnas as wooden and unnatural when they satisfied everyone else
- Botticelli repenting, Fra Bartolommeo burning work: great art was once considered shocking
