# Skills

This directory contains agent skills that extend Claude Code's capabilities.

## Structure

Each skill should be organized as:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md           # Main skill definition (required)
├── README.md          # Usage documentation
├── examples/          # Example usage
└── tools/            # Supporting scripts or tools
```

## Creating a Skill

A `SKILL.md` file should include:

1. **Purpose**: What the skill does
2. **Triggers**: When the skill should activate
3. **Instructions**: Step-by-step workflow
4. **Examples**: Usage examples
5. **Dependencies**: Required tools or plugins
