## Proven Examples That Got Responses

### Example 1: High Schooler to CEO (Niraj Pant to Evan Spiegel, Snapchat)

Extreme brevity. Three bullets. Worked.

```
Hey, my name's Niraj Pant.

I understand your time is valuable. I'll only write three bullet points.

- Programming since 8th grade.
- Have most experience working in Java/Obj-C/Android/iOS.
- Want to intern for Snapchat this summer as a high school junior.

How?
```

**Why it worked**: Radically short. Specific tech stack. Bold one-word ask. Respects the reader's time by design.

### Example 2: Copywriter to Startup Founder

Opens with genuine product praise, then pivots to a soft ask.

```
Hey Ryan - [product] is so good. Used it last week for [reason] and was
impressed (especially by how good the notification selection/timing is).

Question: how are you doing on copywriting at the moment?

Asking because I write for startups.

Don't want to blast you with a wall of text so re: work background, that's
mostly on the site in my email address. Happy to share a bunch of past work
if it would be helpful.
```

**Why it worked**: Authentic product usage (not fake). Low-pressure ask. Offers proof without forcing it. Conversational tone.

### Example 3: Engineer to Seed-Stage Startup

Classic three-part structure executed well.

```
Hey Kevin - heard about Your Company from a friend. I'm emailing because I
saw you just raised a seed round and I'd like to help you build the product.
Two things that may be relevant:

- I worked at That Company, where I helped to build Successful Feature
  (big driver of ARR).
- I built Personal Project, which currently has 100,000 active users.

Can share more about other work, but feel like these two are perhaps the
most relevant.

I think I could help you build out [Product] quickly and would like to
learn more.

Worth a chat?
```

**Why it worked**: Clear reason for reaching out (seed round). Two specific, impressive bullets. Humble framing ("perhaps the most relevant"). Easy ask.

## Mindset Reminders

When the user is hesitant or overthinking:

- **You're not bothering anyone.** Hiring managers and founders want to find great people. You're helping them.
- **Rejection is data.** Every non-response teaches something. Iterate.
- **Volume is your friend.** Don't pin all hope on one email. Batch 10-30 companies.
- **80% sent beats 100% unsent.** An imperfect email sent today beats a perfect one you never send.
